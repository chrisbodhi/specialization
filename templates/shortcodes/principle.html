{#
  Principle shortcode — for core tenets, foundational rules, or key maxims.

  Use this when content naturally takes the form of numbered principles or
  fundamental rules worth calling out with visual weight. Not a replacement
  for blockquotes (external voices), sidenotes (tangents), or warnings (cautions).

  Good fit: "The three principles of good knife work..."
  Bad fit: Forcing content into this shape just to use the component.

  Parameters:
    - title (required): The principle's heading
    - number (optional): Display number like "01", "02", etc.

  Usage:
    {% principle(title="Keep It Sharp") %}
    A dull knife is more dangerous than a sharp one.
    {% end %}

    {% principle(title="Keep It Sharp", number="01") %}
    A dull knife is more dangerous than a sharp one.
    {% end %}
